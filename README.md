# Continuous Integration Tool

This project is a Continuous Integration (CI) tool designed to automate the process of software development. It provides a framework for managing pipelines and executing jobs, similar to Jenkins.

## Features

- **Pipeline Management**: Create and manage CI pipelines with multiple jobs.
- **Job Execution**: Define and execute individual jobs within a pipeline.
- **API Integration**: Access and manage pipelines and jobs through a RESTful API.
- **Web Interface**: A user-friendly web interface to monitor and control CI processes.
